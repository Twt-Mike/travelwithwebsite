                Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Craig. Your friendly Scotsman in Japan! ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
              </p>
              <p>
                I've spent years traveling the world, but nowhere has felt more like homeâ€”yet still full of surprisesâ€”than Japan. Growing up in the north of Scotland as a classic PokÃ©mon kid, I never imagined that my first trip to Japan in 2018 would change everything. I fell in love with the food, the culture, the people, and the unique rhythm of life here. Now, I get to share all of that with you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traveling with me isn't just about ticking off the 'must-see' spotsâ€”it's about experiencing Japan like a local. We'll dive into every aspect of the culture, from incredible food and drink to stunning temples and shrines, and, of course, the wonderfully weird and quirky side of the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the way, I'll teach you local customs, handy language tips, and take you to the best hidden gems I've discoveredâ€”so you can truly experience the magic of Japan. Let's make some unforgettable memories together! ðŸ˜Š
